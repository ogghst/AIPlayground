# LangGraph Chatbot Architecture

this rule outlines a comprehensive architecture for a Python chatbot built with LangGraph, focusing on the modular structure that enables flexible, state-based conversational flows.

## Core Modules

### 1. State Management Module
**Purpose**: Maintains the conversation state and context throughout interactions.

**Functionalities**:
- Defines the state schema (messages, memory, user information, conversation history)
- Handles state transitions between different nodes in the conversation graph
- Provides access to current and historical states
- Manages persistence of state across conversation sessions

**Relations**: Serves as the foundation that all other modules interact with; provides context to the LLM Module and receives updates from the Processing Module.

### 2. LLM Integration Module
**Purpose**: Interfaces with large language models to generate responses.

**Functionalities**:
- Connects to LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
- Handles prompt construction and templating
- Manages model parameters (temperature, max tokens)
- Implements fallback mechanisms for model errors
- Applies response formatting standards

**Relations**: Receives state from State Management Module; passes generated content to Processing Module; may interact with Tool Integration for enhanced capabilities.

### 3. Processing Module
**Purpose**: Orchestrates the flow of conversation and applies transformations to messages.

**Functionalities**:
- Implements branching logic based on user intent
- Applies filtering, moderation, and enhancement to generated responses
- Routes the conversation to specialized handlers based on detected needs
- Handles conversation flow transitions (greetings, main dialog, conclusions)

**Relations**: Acts as the central coordinator between State Management, LLM Integration, and Tool Integration; updates state after processing.

### 4. Tool Integration Module
**Purpose**: Extends chatbot capabilities with external functionalities.

**Functionalities**:
- Provides framework for tool registration and discovery
- Handles tool execution and result processing
- Manages authentication for external services
- Implements error handling for tool operations

**Relations**: Receives requests from Processing Module; may provide context to LLM Module for response generation; updates state with tool results.

### 5. Graph Definition Module
**Purpose**: Defines the conversational flow using LangGraph's graph structure.

**Functionalities**:
- Creates nodes representing different states or functions
- Defines edges and transitions between nodes
- Implements conditional routing logic
- Provides visualization capabilities for the graph

**Relations**: Interacts with State Management to determine transitions; coordinates with Processing Module for executing node functions.

## Supporting Modules

### 6. Input Processing Module
**Purpose**: Handles and normalizes user inputs.

**Functionalities**:
- Implements text preprocessing
- Handles multimodal inputs (text, images, files)
- Detects input language and applies translations if needed
- Extracts entities and intents from user messages

**Relations**: Provides processed input to State Management and Processing Module.

### 7. Memory & Context Module
**Purpose**: Manages longer-term memory and contextual understanding.

**Functionalities**:
- Implements retrieval-augmented generation capabilities
- Manages vector storage for semantic search
- Handles document chunking and embedding
- Provides context windows management (sliding, summarized)

**Relations**: Enhances State Management with long-term memory; provides context to LLM Integration for improved responses.

### 8. Evaluation & Monitoring Module
**Purpose**: Tracks and assesses chatbot performance.

**Functionalities**:
- Logs conversations and system operations
- Calculates performance metrics (response time, user satisfaction)
- Identifies failure modes and edge cases
- Provides dashboards for monitoring

**Relations**: Observes all other modules; may provide feedback to Processing Module for continuous improvement.

### 9. Configuration Module
**Purpose**: Manages system settings and environment integration.

**Functionalities**:
- Handles API keys and credentials
- Provides environment-specific configurations
- Manages feature flags and deployment options
- Implements configuration validation

**Relations**: Provides settings to all other modules; may be updated by Evaluation Module based on performance needs.

## Integration Flow

The architecture works through a cyclical flow:

1. User input is received and normalized by the Input Processing Module
2. The State Management Module updates with new input
3. The Graph Definition Module determines the next node to execute
4. The Processing Module orchestrates necessary operations
5. If needed, Tool Integration Module executes external functions
6. The LLM Integration Module generates appropriate responses
7. The Memory & Context Module updates with new information
8. The response is delivered to the user
9. The Evaluation & Monitoring Module tracks the interaction quality

This architecture provides a robust foundation for developing conversational AI applications with LangGraph, allowing for both simple chatbots and complex conversational agents with sophisticated tooling and memory capabilities.
